# Learning Django

### About
Fun summer work in 2018, involving me failing miserably at Django (and succeeding...sometimes). And failure is always very entertaining, so why not let the github community know about it for some cheap laughs?

### Notes
I've been following the [Python & Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp) course from Jose Portilla in Udemy. This repository holds my work for Django Level Two to the Clone Blog Project. See the markdown files on their respective folders for a gist of what's going on.
